# .NET Developer Interview Challenge: Secure & AI-Assisted Notification API

## Overview
Welcome to the interview assignment! You are tasked with completing and securing a backend RESTful Web API for a **Notification Management System** using **.NET 10** and **SQLite**. 

To simulate a modern development workflow, **you are encouraged and expected to use AI assistants** (such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Claude) to accelerate your coding, generate logic, and verify your implementation.

**Repository Name:** `interview-dotnet-api`  
**C# Namespace:** `interview_dotnet_api`  
**Time Limit:** 60 Minutes

## Technical Objectives

### Task 1: Secure the API (20 Minutes)
The starter project has a `NotificationController` with fully functional CRUD endpoints, but it is currently completely insecure and open to the public.

1. **Enforce Authentication**: Protect all `Notification` endpoints using the pre-configured JWT authentication system. Unauthenticated requests must return `401 Unauthorized`.
2. **Implement Data Isolation**: Modify the data access logic so that users can **only** view, dispatch, update, or delete notifications belonging to them.
   * Extract the User ID from the authenticated token claims (`User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)`).
   * Ensure User A cannot access, read, or delete User B's notifications by guessing a notification ID.

### Task 2: AI-Assisted Smart Categorisation (20 Minutes)
Use an AI assistant of your choice to implement an automated keyword/channel parser.

1. **The Feature**: When a new notification is created (`POST /api/notifications`), the system must automatically assign a `Category` tag (e.g., *Marketing*, *Security*, *Billing*, or *System*) based on keywords found in the notification title or body message.
2. **The AI Constraint**: Write a prompt for your AI assistant to generate a lightweight, regex-based, or dictionary-based classification method in C#. Integration of external paid AI APIs is **not** required—keep the logic local and fast.
3. **Update Model**: Ensure the `NotificationItem` model handles and saves this new `Category` property to the database.

### Task 3: AI Submission & Review (20 Minutes)
Document your workflow to demonstrate how you collaborate with AI.

1. Save your AI prompt history. You can export a chat link, take screenshots, or copy-paste the text into a `prompts.txt` file.
2. Ask your AI assistant to review your Task 1 security implementation for potential vulnerabilities, and note any changes you made based on its feedback.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be scored out of 100 points based on:

* **Security Awareness (40%):** Correct application of user claims mapping and complete prevention of horizontal privilege escalation (ID tampering across tenant notifications).
* **AI Collaboration (30%):** Prompt engineering skills. We look for specific, iterative, and critical prompts rather than blind copy-pasting of broken code.
* **Code Quality & Velocity (20%):** Working endpoints that compile successfully, utilize proper HTTP status codes, and use asynchronous EF Core methods.
* **Git Hygiene (10%):** Atomic commits detailing what was achieved in each phase.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or extract the provided ZIP file.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio, VS Code, or Rider.
3. Run the migrations to initialize your local SQLite database:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
4. Start the application to access the Swagger/OpenAPI documentation:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

Good luck!
